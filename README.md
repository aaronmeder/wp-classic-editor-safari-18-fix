# Wordpress Classic Editor Two Column Fix for Safari 18

Safari 18, bundled with macOS Sequoia, introduced a problem with the default Two Column view in the Classic Editor of WordPress, making the columns overlap.

This plugin loads two minimal lines of CSS to fix the issue, until there will be an official fix.
